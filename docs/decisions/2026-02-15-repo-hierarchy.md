## 5. DIRECTORY NAMING CONVENTIONS

### Course Directories
All course directories follow the pattern: `[COURSE-CODE]-[Descriptive-Title]`

Examples:
- `courses/BUS-314-International-Business-Finance`
- `courses/BUS-620-Micro-And-Macro-Economics`
- `courses/FIN-321-International-Finance`

**Rationale:**
* Course code enables easy identification
* Descriptive title provides context without opening files
* Consistent capitalization (PascalCase with hyphens) improves readability
* Alphabetical sorting groups courses by code

### Internal Project Directories
Within each course, project subdirectories follow a clear naming convention:

- `project-[project-name]/` – Active project with latest materials
- `archive/` – Historical versions and past deliverables
- `_templates/` – Reusable templates with underscore prefix (convention for tooling)
- `_spreadsheets/` – Supporting Excel models and calculations

### Special Directories
Prefixed with `_` to denote system/organizational directories:
- `_archive/` – Historical materials and deprecated courses
- `_claude/` – IDE-specific configuration
- `docs/_branding/` – Brand assets and design system
- `docs/decisions/` – Strategic decision memos
- `docs/templates/` – Reusable templates across all courses

## 6. FILE ORGANIZATION WITHIN PROJECTS

### Standard Project Workflow
Each major project follows this file structure:

```
project-[name]/
├── README.md                           # Assignment brief & learning objectives
├── stage1-memo-assignment.md           # Memo writing stage
├── stage2-excel-build-assignment.md    # Spreadsheet/quantitative modeling
├── stage3-spec-assignment.md           # Specification/documentation (post-build)
├── stage4-final-analysis-assignment.md # Final analysis, prompt & recommendations
├── template-memo.md                    # Template for stage 1 deliverable
├── template-spec.md                    # Template for stage 3 deliverable
├── _templates/
│   └── excel/
│       ├── README.md                   # Instructions for template use
│       └── [Model].xlsx                # Skeleton Excel workbook
└── archive/
    ├── specs/
    ├── prompts/
    ├── analysis/
    └── deliverables/
```

### README.md Files (Course-Level)
Located at `[Course-Directory]/README.md`, each course README contains:

1. **Course Header** – Title and institutional affiliation
2. **Course Overview** – 2–3 sentence description of content and focus
3. **Instructor** – Name, email, and link to `BIO.md`
4. **Learning Objectives / Topics** – Core competencies and subject matter
5. **Course Outline** – General progression through topics (no specific dates)
6. **Skills Gained** – Workplace-ready competencies developed
7. **Grading** – Grading breakdown (table format)
8. **Grading Components** – Detailed descriptions of each assessment
9. **AI Use Policy** – Guidelines for AI tools in coursework
10. **Campus Policies** – Disability accommodations, academic honesty, etc.

**Design Rationale:** This standardized structure makes courses comparable and maintainable, while removing time-sensitive information (dates, room numbers, specific schedules).

---

## 7. VERSIONING AND ARCHIVES

### Version Control Strategy
- **Active Materials** – Stored in project directories with clear stage labels
- **Historical Materials** – Moved to `archive/` subdirectories within projects
- **Deprecated Courses** – Moved to root-level `_archive/` directory

### Archive Subdirectories
Within projects, `archive/` contains:
- `specs/` – Past project specifications
- `prompts/` – AI prompt logs and engineering notes
- `analysis/` – Student work samples and analysis
- `deliverables/` – Template deliverables from past semesters

---

## 8. SPECIAL FILES AND THEIR PURPOSES

### `.md` (Markdown) Files
- **`README.md`** – Main documentation for each directory
- **`assignment-*.md`** – Assignment instructions for specific stages
- **`template-*.md`** – Templates for deliverables
- **`*-memo.md`** – Memo templates and samples
- **`*-spec.md`** – Project specification templates

### `.xlsx` (Excel) Files
- **Naming:** `[Project-Name]-[Purpose].xlsx` or `[Project-Name]-MASTER.xlsx`
- **Purpose:** Financial models, calculations, scenario analysis
- **Location:** `_spreadsheets/` or `_templates/excel/`

### Configuration Files
- **`.gitignore`** – Git exclusion rules
- Purpose: System configuration and tooling

---

## 9. NAVIGATION AND CROSS-LINKING

### Link Structure
- **Internal Links:** Use relative paths (e.g., `../BIO.md` for parent directory)
- **Cross-Course Links:** Link to projects in other courses via relative paths
- **External Links:** Use full URLs for university resources and external sites

### Directory Traversal
- Course directories contain project subdirectories
- Projects reference course-specific templates via `_templates/` subdirectories
- All projects can reference root-level `BIO.md`
- All courses can reference reusable templates in `docs/templates/`
- All materials can reference brand guidelines in `docs/_branding/`
- All stakeholders can reference decisions in `docs/decisions/`

## 10. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAINTENANCE

### When Adding New Courses
1. Create directory: `[CODE]-[Descriptive-Title]` (matching capitalization)
2. Add `README.md` following the standard template
3. Create project subdirectory if applicable: `project-[name]/`
4. Include stage workflow files if multi-phase project (4 or 5 stages depending on course)
5. Create `archive/` subdirectory for future versions

### When Updating Materials
1. Use `archive/` subdirectories to preserve past versions
2. Update `README.md` with current course structure (no specific dates)
3. Maintain consistent file naming and capitalization
4. Use descriptive file names that indicate purpose and stage

### Git Commit Messages
- Include directory/file names: "Update FIN-321 project templates"
- Reference specific changes: "Add course outline section to BUS-620 README"
- Include session ID for traceability

## 12. CONCLUSION

This repository is organized to balance:
- **Clarity** – Descriptive names and consistent structure
- **Scalability** – Easy to add new courses and projects
- **Maintainability** – Version control and clear workflows
- **Discoverability** – Logical hierarchy and cross-linking

The centralization of documentation, templates, and brand guidelines under `/docs/` creates a unified hub for all supporting materials, while course directories remain focused on course-specific content. The use of `_` prefix for system/organizational directories, descriptive course names, and standardized project workflows ensures that the repository remains navigable and professional as it grows.
